tips and tricks:

1. Do not over beat your batter once the flour and cocoa powder are added. That creates air pockets in the batter which will give you cake-like textured brownies.

2. Please try not to over bake them. We liked ours at around 20 minutes in the oven. You can go a little bit over if you like them set a bit more, Remember, they will continue to bake slightly in the hot pan once pulled out of the oven. It's a good idea to use baking paper so you can pull them out of the pan a lot easier after about 10-15 minutes from the oven, and place your brownie GENTLY on a cooling rack.

3. Bake your brownies on the top shelf in your oven. The middle shelf cooks them a lot faster, slightly burns them on the top and dries them out a little. Your oven may work differently, but this is a tip if you don't want burnt brownies.

And enjoy your brownie!
